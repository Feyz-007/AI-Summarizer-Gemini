Family structure in India is shifting, though the family remains the most important social unit. While extended families were traditionally the norm, nuclear families are now more prevalent, accounting for over half of households in both urban and rural areas according to the NFHS-5 (2019-21).  Marriage is almost universal, but divorce is uncommon, although separation rates are rising.  Most marriages are arranged, considering factors like caste, economic status, and astrology, with the bride typically moving to her husband's home.  Love marriages are increasingly common in urban areas.

Key aspects of Indian family dynamics include:

* **Hierarchical Structure:**  A clear social hierarchy exists based on gender, age, and (for women) the number of sons. The senior male typically heads the household, with his wife managing female tasks. Males hold higher status than females, leading to disparities in mortality and morbidity rates, and historically, to female infanticide and sex-selective abortions.  However, there's been a slight improvement in women's participation in financial decisions.

* **Dowry System:** The preference for male children is largely due to the dowry system, a significant financial burden on the bride's family. Though illegal since 1961, dowry-related harassment persists.  

* **Gender Roles and Expectations:** Traditionally, wives were expected to be completely obedient to their husbands.  Widow remarriage is restricted in some caste groups.
